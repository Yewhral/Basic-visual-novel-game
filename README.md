My testing ground for learning more about JS and different frameworks/libraries

Hey all! 
I don't know how you discovered this repo, but it's nice to see you!
I'm working on my own project here, it will be my first responsive design, first experience with phaser and first experience with gulp!
If you find some critical errors in my code please let me know. When I finish some more code I will definitely put it somewhere on the Internet so stay tuned!

Edit: 18/06/2017
The code is alive! Visit http://zabrzyjewski.net.pl if you are intersted how it turned out. I'm fully aware of the fact it's far from perfection, and I'm still working on it, but the excitement is real and I couldn't stop myself from sharing it with other people
